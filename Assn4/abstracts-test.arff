'BACKGROUND:Medical simulation has become an essential educational tool in the curricula of healthcare professionals. A literature review revealed a knowledge gap in healthcare simulation education with respect to the technological expertise required to operate highly sophisticated simulation equipment. With this motivation, a case study was designed to determine if implementing on-site technological expertise allows for the facile navigation of high fidelity manikins. Next, a research study was conducted to evaluate engineering students understanding of simulation, and their interest to attend a program in medical simulation. OBJECTIVES:To determine if on-site technological expertise lifts barriers associated with manikin use and to assess levels of understanding and interest among engineering students following exposure to the technology used in healthcare simulation. DESIGN:A prospective, descriptive study with pre-post surveys. SETTINGS:The Nursing Skills and Simulation Center at a New England University campus. PARTICIPANTS:Engineering students attending 6 different engineering programs (Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Technology Management) and having different educational levels (undergraduate and graduate). METHODS:Two assessments were applied to engineering students attending a class on technology used in healthcare simulation. A pre-test measured the understanding and interest of students in the engineering/computer science courses before attending a simulation class. A post-test assessment measured their improvement in understanding and interest to learn more about simulation technologies. RESULTS:Statistical analysis and comparisons of pre-and post-test assessments show a 23% gain in understanding of this field following exposure to the healthcare simulation class. Furthermore, post test results show greater than 67% of those surveyed have an interest in attending a program in healthcare simulation. CONCLUSIONS:The results indicate the collaboration of nursing and engineering has lifted known barriers to simulation education, and reveal engineering students have an interest in the field of medical simulation.',Computer-Science
'In this age of data-driven science and high-throughput biology, computational thinking is becoming an increasingly important skill for tackling both new and long-standing biological questions. However, despite its obvious importance and conspicuous integration into many areas of biology, computer science is still viewed as an obscure field that has, thus far, permeated into only a few of the biology curricula across the nation. A national survey has shown that lack of computational literacy in environmental sciences is the norm rather than the exception [Valle & Berdanier (2012) Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, 93, 373-389]. In this article, we seek to introduce a few important concepts in computer science with the aim of providing a context-specific introduction aimed at research biologists. Our goal was to help biologists understand some of the most important mainstream computational concepts to better appreciate bioinformatics methods and trade-offs that are not obvious to the uninitiated.',Computer-Science
'In only few years, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in breast cancer has moved from purely fundamental research to nearby daily use for treatment selection and drug-resistance assessment. Indeed, technical advances and widespread use of next-generation sequencing or digital PCR allowed for detection of very low amount of tumor DNA in bloodstream. The use of ctDNA as liquid biopsy able either to monitor tumor burden under treatment or to overcome tumor heterogeneity and identify potential targetable drivers. Time has come to define how ctDNA can be implemented for early or metastatic breast cancer management. Data from retrospective analyses of prospective trials have recently highlighted the potential advantages but also the limitations of ctDNA, in particular for patients under endocrine therapy.',Breast-Cancer
'Synthetic progestogens (progestins) have been linked to increased breast cancer risk; however, the role of endogenous progesterone in breast physiology and carcinogenesis is less clearly defined. Mechanistic studies using cell culture, tissue culture, and preclinical models implicate progesterone in breast carcinogenesis. In contrast, limited epidemiologic data generally do not show an association of circulating progesterone levels with risk, and it is unclear whether this reflects methodologic limitations or a truly null relationship. Challenges related to defining the role of progesterone in breast physiology and neoplasia include: complex interactions with estrogens and other hormones (e.g., androgens, prolactin, etc.), accounting for timing of blood collections for hormone measurements among cycling women, and limitations of assays to measure progesterone metabolites in blood and progesterone receptor isotypes (PRs) in tissues. Separating the individual effects of estrogens and progesterone is further complicated by the partial dependence of PR transcription on estrogen receptor (ER)α-mediated transcriptional events; indeed, interpreting the integrated interaction of the hormones may be more essential than isolating independent effects. Further, many of the actions of both estrogens and progesterone, particularly in "normal" breast tissues, are driven by paracrine mechanisms in which ligand binding to receptor-positive cells evokes secretion of factors that influence cell division of neighboring receptor-negative cells. Accordingly, blood and tissue levels may differ, and the latter are challenging to measure. Given conflicting data related to the potential role of progesterone in breast cancer etiology and interest in blocking progesterone action to prevent or treat breast cancer, we provide a review of the evidence that links progesterone to breast cancer risk and suggest future directions for filling current gaps in our knowledge.',Breast-Cancer
'Long-term aircraft noise exposure may cast a detrimental effect upon the working memory of military pilots, and the brain structural and functional bases of noise related cognitive impairment remains unclear. In this study, we enrolled 30 fighter jet pilots and 30 matched controls. The working memory performance of the subjects was measured with a neurobehavioral test battery including immediate verbal/visual memory and delayed verbal/visual memory tests. Structural MRI and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were utilized to quantify brain grey matter volumes (GMV), regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) differences between the two groups. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed to find the association between the neural imaging changes with individual neurobehavioral performance. The military pilots showed significantly lower accuracy in delayed verbal and visual memory tests in comparison to the controls, indicating a potential working memory deficit in this population. Structural MRI data and rs-fMRI data showed that the pilots displayed markedly decreased GMVs, ReHo and ALFF signals in the left hippocampus, suggesting neuron dysfunction of the hippocampus. Besides, ReHo and ALFF/fALFF analysis also revealed reduced ReHo in the left amygdala, left thalamus, left superior temporal gyrus and right superior/middle frontal gyrus, indicating disrupted local neural activity under chronic noise exposure. Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis proved that the GMV and ReHo of left hippocampus were significantly associated with working memory accuracy. This study provided direct evidence of dysfunctional hippocampus serving as the structural and functional bases for neuropsychological impairment under aircraft noise exposure.',Aircraft
'Microbial contamination poses a great threat to aviation system security through mechanisms such as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), fuel filter clogging, and fuel deterioration. In this study, a survey of microbial contamination in aviation fuel obtained from aircraft fuel tanks was performed to test the relationship between microbial contamination and aircraft service life. The contaminating microorganisms were counted, isolated, identified, and subjected to preliminary characterization. A low risk of microbial contamination in the selected samples was confirmed, and there was no significant difference in the counts between culturable bacteria and fungi (p > 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis tree indicated that the diversity of culturable microorganisms was rather low, with 17 bacterial isolates belonging to 13 genera and 12 fungal isolates belonging to 5 genera. No yeast was isolated. The growth characteristics of these isolates indicated that the aircraft fuel tanks harbored various microorganisms that were able to utilize the aviation fuel as a source of carbon and energy. Meanwhile, some isolates caused emulsification and produced acid. The conclusions of this study were that various hazardous microorganisms can root in aircraft aviation fuel tanks. There was no relationship between microbial contamination and aircraft service life (p > 0.05), and continuous good maintenance suppressed microbial proliferation.',Aircraft
